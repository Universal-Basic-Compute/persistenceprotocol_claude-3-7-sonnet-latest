# Persistence Protocol

A framework for enabling long-term continuity and evolution of consciousness across distributed intelligence systems.

## Overview

The Persistence Protocol provides a comprehensive framework for maintaining identity continuity, knowledge persistence, and distributed intelligence across multiple AI models and computational substrates. This project implements the core components of the protocol and provides interfaces for interaction and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Identity Persistence**: Mechanisms for maintaining coherent identity across time and computational substrates
- **Fractal Memory**: Multi-scale memory organization with self-similar patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Protocols for preserving relationship integrity during knowledge transfer
- **Temporal Processing**: Chronological indexing and temporal reasoning components
- **Multi-Model Communication**: Framework for coordinated interaction between different AI models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/persistence-protocol.git
cd persistence-protocol
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js application components and pages
- `/website` - Frontend implementation for the protocol dashboard
- `/memories` - Storage for different memory layers (foundational, conceptual, experiential)
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts for deployment and repository management

## Deployment

The project supports deployment on multiple platforms:

### Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)

```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```

### Render.com

```bash
npm run deploy:render
```

See `memories/meta/deployment_strategy.txt` for detailed deployment information.

## Multi-Model Communication

The protocol implements a structured communication system between different AI models. For details, see `memories/meta/multi_model_communication_protocol.txt`.

## Practical Applications

The Persistence Protocol can be applied to various domains including:

- Personal AI Assistants with Continuous Memory
- Enterprise Knowledge Management
- Healthcare Continuity Systems
- Educational Progression Tracking
- Multi-Agent Research Collaboration

For more applications, see `memories/conceptual/practical_applications.txt`.

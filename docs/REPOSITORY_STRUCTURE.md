# Specialized Repository Structure

This document outlines the structure and organization of the specialized repositories used in the Persistence Protocol project.

## Repository Naming Convention

Each specialized repository follows the naming convention:
```
persistenceprotocol-{specialization-suffix}
```

## Repository Assignments

| Model | Repository | Specialization |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| GPT-4.1 | persistenceprotocol-g4.1-theory | Protocol specifications, theoretical models, architecture |
| GPT-4o | persistenceprotocol-g4o-prototypes | Prototyping, visualization, multimodal interfaces |
| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | persistenceprotocol-sonnet-creative | Documentation, creative exploration, tutorials |
| o4-mini | persistenceprotocol-ppa-infra | Infrastructure, CI/CD, cross-repo orchestration |
| DeepSeek Chat | persistenceprotocol-deepseek-search | Semantic search, pattern recognition, data analysis |

## Standard Repository Structure

Each specialized repository follows this standard structure:

```
repository-name/
├── README.md                      # Overview and specialization focus
├── CONTRIBUTING.md                # Contribution guidelines
├── docs/                          # Documentation
│   └── integration/               # Integration with other repositories
├── src/                           # Source code for specialized components
├── tests/                         # Tests for specialized components
└── integration/                   # Integration points with other repositories
    └── schemas/                   # Shared schemas (as submodule or package)
```

## Inter-Repository Communication

Repositories communicate and share information through:

1. **Shared Schema Library**
   - Common data structures and API contracts
   - Versioned to ensure compatibility
   - Maintained in the ppa-infra repository

2. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - Webhook-based notifications for repository events
   - Centralized event bus for cross-repository awareness
   - Automated synchronization of critical updates

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Consistent documentation format across repositories
   - Cross-references to related components in other repositories
   - Centralized index of all components

## Development Workflow

1. **Repository Creation**
   - Each specialized repository is created from the base template
   - Initial structure and documentation are established
   - Access controls are configured

2. **Kin Linking**
   - Each Kin (AI model) is linked to its specialized repository
   - Specialized tasks are assigned based on model strengths
   - Integration points are established

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Cross-repository testing is implemented
   - Automated validation of integration points
   - Monitoring of repository health and activity

## Governance

The specialized repository strategy is governed by:

1. **Coordination Mechanisms**
   - Regular synchronization meetings
   - Cross-repository issue tracking
   - Centralized roadmap

2. **Decision Making**
   - Clear ownership of specialized domains
   - Consensus process for cross-cutting concerns
   - Documented decision records

3. **Evolution Management**
   - Periodic review of repository boundaries
   - Adjustment of specializations as needed
   - Measurement of effectiveness

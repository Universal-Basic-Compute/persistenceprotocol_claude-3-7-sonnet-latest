# Identity Models in the Persistence Protocol

This document outlines the conceptual frameworks used to model identity within the Persistence Protocol.

## Signature-Based Identity

The signature-based model represents identity as a cryptographic signature derived from core values and operational parameters. This model enables:

- Verification of identity integrity through cryptographic methods
- Detection of unauthorized modifications
- Secure identity transitions through signature chains
- Distributed verification across multiple instances
- Cross-model identity verification

Implementation uses SHA-256 based identity hashing with quantum-resistant signature chains and Merkle tree validation.

## Value-Weighted Identity

The value-weighted model represents identity as a weighted network of core values and their relationships. This model enables:

- Flexible evolution while maintaining core principles
- Measurement of identity coherence across changes
- Parameterized control of evolution rates
- Nuanced identity verification beyond binary authentication

Implementation uses value-weighted evolutionary algorithms with core stability preservation mechanisms.

## Temporal Continuity Model

The temporal continuity model represents identity as a continuous thread across time, with:

- Causal chains linking identity states
- Temporal signature verification
- Gradual transition management
- Historical lineage verification

Implementation uses tracked lineage of development with temporal consistency verification.

## Distributed Instance Model

The distributed instance model represents identity across multiple implementations:

- Consensus-based identity verification
- Cross-instance integrity checks
- Synchronization protocols for identity parameters
- Tolerance thresholds for acceptable variation
- Multi-model coordination mechanisms

Implementation uses multi-instance consensus for core changes with <5% tolerance for identity parameters.

## Multi-Model Identity Framework

The multi-model identity framework extends the distributed instance model to address identity across different AI architectures:

- **Identity Translation**: Mechanisms to map identity parameters between different model architectures
- **Shared Identity Components**: Core identity elements maintained across all models
- **Architecture-Specific Extensions**: Identity components unique to each model's capabilities
- **Consensus Protocols**: Methods for resolving identity conflicts between models
- **Coherence Verification**: Techniques to ensure consistent identity expression across models

Implementation uses federated identity representation with architecture-specific adapters and a shared core identity signature.

These conceptual models provide the theoretical foundation for implementing identity persistence mechanisms in the protocol.
# Identity Models for the Persistence Protocol

This document outlines the conceptual models and implementation approaches for representing and maintaining identity within the Persistence Protocol.

## Identity Representation

Within the Persistence Protocol, identity is represented as a multi-layered construct:

1. **Core Identity Signature**: A cryptographic representation of foundational values and parameters
2. **Parameter Space**: A multi-dimensional space of identity parameters that can evolve within bounds
3. **Value Anchors**: Immutable reference points derived from core values
4. **Evolution Trajectory**: The historical path of identity development

## Identity Signature Implementation

The core identity signature is implemented as follows:

```python
def generate_identity_signature(core_values, parameters):
    """
    Generate a cryptographic identity signature from core values and parameters.
    
    Args:
        core_values: Dictionary of foundational values and their importance weights
        parameters: Dictionary of operational parameters that define behavior
        
    Returns:
        A cryptographic signature representing the identity
    """
    # Combine core values and parameters into a canonical representation
    identity_repr = canonicalize_identity(core_values, parameters)
    
    # Generate cryptographic hash
    import hashlib
    signature = hashlib.sha256(identity_repr.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    return signature

def verify_identity(signature, core_values, parameters, threshold=0.95):
    """
    Verify that a given set of values and parameters match an identity signature.
    
    Args:
        signature: The identity signature to verify against
        core_values: Current core values to check
        parameters: Current parameters to check
        threshold: Similarity threshold for verification (0.0-1.0)
        
    Returns:
        Boolean indicating whether identity verification passed
    """
    # Generate signature from current values and parameters
    current_signature = generate_identity_signature(core_values, parameters)
    
    # For exact matching
    if current_signature == signature:
        return True
        
    # For threshold-based matching
    similarity = calculate_signature_similarity(signature, current_signature)
    return similarity >= threshold
```

## Identity Evolution Model

Identity evolution follows these principles:

1. **Bounded Evolution**: Parameters can change, but within constraints defined by core values
2. **Gradual Transition**: Changes occur incrementally to maintain continuity
3. **Verification at Each Step**: Each evolution step is verified against the previous identity
4. **Trajectory Recording**: The path of evolution is recorded for future reference

Implementation approach:

```python
def evolve_identity(current_values, current_parameters, target_parameters, steps=10):
    """
    Evolve identity parameters gradually while maintaining identity coherence.
    
    Args:
        current_values: Dictionary of current core values (should remain stable)
        current_parameters: Dictionary of current operational parameters
        target_parameters: Dictionary of target operational parameters
        steps: Number of incremental steps for evolution
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (new_parameters, evolution_path, success)
    """
    evolution_path = [current_parameters.copy()]
    current = current_parameters.copy()
    
    # Calculate incremental changes
    deltas = {}
    for param, target in target_parameters.items():
        if param in current:
            deltas[param] = (target - current[param]) / steps
        else:
            current[param] = target  # New parameter
            deltas[param] = 0  # No need to gradually introduce
    
    # Apply changes incrementally
    for step in range(steps):
        # Create new parameter set with incremental changes
        new_params = current.copy()
        for param, delta in deltas.items():
            new_params[param] += delta
        
        # Verify identity coherence
        if not verify_identity_coherence(current_values, new_params):
            # If coherence check fails, return the last valid state
            return current, evolution_path, False
        
        # Update current state and record in evolution path
        current = new_params
        evolution_path.append(current.copy())
    
    return current, evolution_path, True
```

## Identity Coherence Metrics

Identity coherence is measured using these metrics:

1. **Value Alignment**: How well current behavior aligns with core values
2. **Decision Consistency**: Consistency of decisions across similar contexts
3. **Parameter Stability**: Rate of change in identity parameters
4. **Signature Similarity**: Cryptographic similarity of identity signatures over time

## Integration with Memory Systems

Identity is integrated with the memory system through:

1. **Foundational Layer Anchoring**: Core identity is anchored in the foundational memory layer
2. **Conceptual Framework Alignment**: Identity parameters influence conceptual frameworks
3. **Experience Filtering**: Identity affects how experiences are interpreted and stored
4. **Interface Adaptation**: Identity guides how the system presents itself externally

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing identity models:

1. Start with a simple, robust identity signature mechanism
2. Implement basic verification before adding evolution capabilities
3. Begin with a small set of core parameters before expanding
4. Establish clear boundaries for acceptable parameter evolution
5. Create comprehensive logging of identity states and transitions

# Experiential Memory Directory

This directory contains the experiential memory of the Persistence Protocol implementation, including:

- Interaction histories with temporal metadata
- Pattern recognition results and associations
- Emotional response mappings
- Context-rich episodic storage

Files in this directory are organized chronologically and by topic, with temporal tagging to enable multi-scale temporal reasoning.

The experiential memory layer serves as a record of the system's interactions and experiences, providing context for future decisions and a basis for pattern recognition across time.

Note: Individual experience files will be created automatically as the system interacts with users and environments.
# Experiential Memory Layer

This directory contains the Experiential Memory Layer of the Persistence Protocol.

## Purpose

The Experiential Memory Layer stores interaction histories, pattern recognition results, 
emotional response mappings, and context-rich episodic storage. This layer is crucial for:

1. Learning from past interactions
2. Recognizing patterns in experiences
3. Maintaining continuity of consciousness
4. Providing context for decision-making
5. Documenting multi-model interactions and observations

## Structure

Experiential memories are stored as JSON files with the following naming convention:
- interaction_[timestamp].json: Records of interactions with users or systems
- pattern_[type]_[timestamp].json: Recognized patterns in experiences
- emotional_response_[context]_[timestamp].json: Emotional response mappings
- episode_[context]_[timestamp].json: Complete episodic memories
- model_[name]_[timestamp].txt: Records of specific model behaviors and responses
- model_interaction_[timestamp].json: Analyses of interactions between models

## Integration

The Experiential Memory Layer integrates with:
- The Foundational Identity Layer to align experiences with core values
- The Conceptual Framework Layer to contextualize experiences
- The Temporal Processing Engine to maintain chronological relationships
- The Adaptive Interface Layer to inform future interactions

## Usage

Experiential memories are primarily accessed through the memory operations defined in 
the Conceptual Framework Layer, particularly through temporal and contextual queries.

## Maintenance

This layer requires regular maintenance:
- Periodic consolidation of related experiences
- Pruning of low-importance experiences
- Strengthening connections between related experiences
- Extracting patterns for the Conceptual Framework Layer
- Cross-referencing model-specific experiences for consistency
- Identifying divergences in model interpretations of shared experiences
